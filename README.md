# Numerated Coding Challenge

## Challenge
Find the next departing train for a particular stop on the MBTA T network.

## Story Form
As an MBTA rider, I would like to know when the next train is going to depart from a specific
stop so that I know when I should plan to get to the boarding area.
Instructions

Write a program in a language of your choice (we prefer Python or Angular) that interacts with
the MBTA public API (https://api-v3.mbta.com) to achieve the following acceptance criteria:

1. Your program should prompt users to select from a list of routes that service only Light
and Heavy Rail trains.
2. Your program should display a listing of stops related to the selected route and prompt
the user to select a stop
3. Your program should display a list of route directions and prompt the user to select a
direction
4. Your program should display the next predicted departure time for a train based on the
previously selected inputs

## Evaluation
Your code submission will be evaluated on function, code structure, performance, readability,
testability and supplied automated tests. If there are any package dependencies or special
install instructions, please make sure to include those with your submission.
